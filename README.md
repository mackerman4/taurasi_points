# Predicting Diana Taurasi's Shooting Success
Diana Taurasi is the best player in the WNBA. She is buried in accolades and broken records and was just named the WNBA GOAT. How can the Phoenix Mercury coaching staff capitalize even more on her scoring abilities? Is Taurasi's scoring productivity related to where on the court she shoots from in a given game? The coaches could use this information to inform new plays intended to set Taurasi up to score. This project is a continuation of a linear regression analysis in which I regressed the percentage of shots made from different zones on the court on the number of points Taurasi made in a game. Building on that project, I now look at how different spots on the court relate to whether she makes a shot.
